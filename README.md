## Build

CSS is built using `postcss` and `tailwindcss`. To build the CSS run:

```bash
npm run css
```

To build the HTML run:

```
npm run build
```

Use any static server to serve the files. For example:

```bash
live-server dist/
```

## Notes

- This contains the front-end code only. The back-end code is left as an exercise for the reader.
- The `dist/` directory contains the built files.
- Scripts are inline for simplicity, as is some CSS.
