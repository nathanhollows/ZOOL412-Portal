<h2>Exec 3: Motor Control of 51U6</h2>

<h2 >
  Strategic Status and Immediate Priorities
</h2>
<p>
  The Tribunal of Great Minds has accepted your argument that species 51U6, as its M phenotype, exceeds threshold criteria for the UN Eucognition Recognition Scale IV, Article II, Schedule I: Embodiment, Step 2: Complex Senses. As such, species 51U6, in any phenotype, is recognised as having a Eucognition Quotient of 0.5. This leaves its protection status unchanged at Unprotected. Your work is commended.
</p>
<p>
  Before KPI can move forward with self-assembler landing, species 51U6 must be tested on at least two further Eucognition Recognition IV categories: Schedule I: Embodiment, Step 3: Agile Movement; Schedule I: Cognition, Step 1: Association. The possibility that species 51U6 may reach SemiProtected status affected profit projections, causing KPI to enter into preliminary negotiations with APE to sell Capricorn site. Your analysis of and expert opinion on 51U6-M’s bioluminescence, that it is not a form of inter-organism communication, has brought profit projections back into the ultra-green and cooled negotiations for the moment. Industrial Intelligence can neither confirm nor deny the presence of APE agents operating undercover in Capricorn site, conducting counter-research. Any evidence that nudges quantitative risk assessment towards predicting a higher Eucognition Quotient gains APE strategic bargaining power. 
</p>
<p>
  Your current assignment is to assess whether 51U6-M meets the criteria of the UN Eucognition Recognition Scale IV Embodiment Step 3: Agile Movement.
